## Concept
- A square board 9 x 9 
- Balls can be placed on each of 81 cells of the board
- Balls in seven colors: black, red, yellow, white, green, blue and magenta

## Aim
To clear the board by getting rid of balls. 
You should place 3 or more balls of the same color along one diagonal, gorizontal or vertical line. These balls disappear.
